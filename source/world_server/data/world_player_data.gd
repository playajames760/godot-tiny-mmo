## Suppose to store the different character IDs of registered accounts.[br][br]
## So if player with name ID "horizon" login to this world,
## we can retrieve its different character IDs thanks to this.[br][br]
## Here is how it should look like:
## [codeblock]
## print(accounts) # {"horizon": [6, 14], "oignon": [2]}
