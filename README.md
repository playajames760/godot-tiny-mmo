# Godot Tiny MMO

A tiny web-based MMORPG demo developed with Godot Engine 4.4,  
created without relying on the built-in multiplayer nodes.

The client and server share the same codebase, but thanks to its unique organization,  
custom export presets allow you to [**Export Client and Server builds separately**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki/Exporting-the-project),  
keeping builds secure and optimized by excluding unnecessary components.

This project contains different types of servers to try to mimic typical MMO architecture:  
gateway, world, and master server (See [Network Architecture diagram in  **#Features**](#features)).

For additional details, check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki).

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in **Godot 4.4**.
2. Go to Debug tab, select **"Customizable Run Instance..."**.
3. Enable **Multiple Instances** and set the count to **4 or more**.
4. Under **Feature Tags**, ensure you have:
   - Exactly **one** "gateway-server" tag.
   - Exactly **one** "master-server" tag.
   - Exactly **one** "world-server" tag.
   - At least **one or more** "client" tags.
5. (Optional) Under **Launch Arguments**:
   - For servers, add **--headless** to prevent empty windows.
   - For any, add **--config=config_file_path.cfg** to use non-default config path.
6. Run the project (Press F5).
